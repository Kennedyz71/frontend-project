# frontend-project: Weather snapShot

#Weather snapShot

This project provides a quick snap shot of the weather in the United States based on the userâ€™s input of City/ST, zip, or Lat/Lon. The snap shot includes local time, elevation, high/low temperature, detailed summary, and a link for an in depth 7 day forecast through weather.gov. The user that would get the most use of this would be someone looking for a quick glance of the weather without getting overloaded with too much information but still have the option to dive deeper.
